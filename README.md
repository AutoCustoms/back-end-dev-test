# Back-End Dev Test

Hello & thank you for your interest in joining our team. We've setup a few little exercises to help assess your skillset.

## PHP Skills Test

### Instructions
Implement a modern PHP command-line application that fetches the list of public repositories for any Github user that is passed as an argument. Display the repository name and the number of star gazers in an aesthetically pleasing table in the terminal sorted by stargazers_count in the order that is specified by an option on the command line.

The application should have all the standard features of a command line application, such as options for viewing help and possibly verbose mode.

Publish your work to a public Github repository and provide detailed instructions in the readme.md file that will allow anyone to install your application and execute it to see the result.

## Node.js Skills Test

### Instructions
Implement the same application in Node.js and publish it to a separate repository.

## Helpful hints
- We do not suffer from [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) around here!
- We love open source software!
- We aspire to have reasonable unit test coverage.
- Emphasis is on “modern” PHP!
